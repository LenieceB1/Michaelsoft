      <h1>Logan whatshisface</h1>
      <p>Logan whatshisface was born in like 2004 or something. He was a student at York County School of Technology, and made it to Sophomore year.</p>
      <p>Logan was an okayish man. He died the way he lived. Quietly. He existed, and then he was gone. Just like that. Bam! He even left his 2021-22 year agenda on his desk. This is so tragic.</p>
      <p>2004(?)-September 2021.</p>
